<!--This sample will create a title header with paragraph text, followed by two side-by-side content items below. In this case these
items are a featured image and text block; the behavior is designed so the text block fills the screen above the right side
text as the page decreases in size. Feature image should be 800x500. Edit text in all CAPS with your content.-->

<!--top section with title and text. change alignment as needed in div class-->
<div class="text-left"><h3>TITLE TEXT</h3>
    <p>SUBTITLE TEXT</p>
</div><br><br>
<!--bottom section; -->
<!--this div defines the image on the left. image should be 800x500-->
<!--note: if photo does not seem to pop to full screen at the right time try replacing col-md-12 with col-sm-12, if
you do so see note below-->
<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
    <br><img
        src="https://dummyimage.com/800x500/"
        class="img-responsive" align="middle" alt="IMAGE TITLE TIP TEXT">
</div>
<!--this element defines the text on the right-->
<!--note: if you make above change change the col-md-12 below to col-sm-12 as well-->
<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
