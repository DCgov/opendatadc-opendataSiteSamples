What is Here
----------
The District of Columbia government has created its open data site using the Esri ArcGIS platform. This provides several widgets and cards for easy drag, drop and configuration of elements provided users have a mature ArcGIS Online organization containing data layers and web apps. In addition to these, DC government uses its own custom elements to further the open data site. Here you will find code samples for DC open data elements along with helpful steps to begin.

Get Organized
----------
We are excited that you have chosen to lead and build an DC open data site. Just remember, your site's primary purpose is to be an <b>open data site</b> - explore, engage, educate and enrichment via data.  Begin by working with a smaller focus. You can always grow the site and its pages.

    Identify an Open Data Team
      Administrator - one admin who will build the site
      Content Editors - group who will author written narratives, create web apps, quality check
      Data Curators - group who will act as data owners


    Inventory Agency Content
      Data on http://opendata.dc.gov
      Apps by agency employees
      New data to curate

Gather Your Toolbox
Edits to these code samples can be done in a standard text document editor such as Notepad in Windows, or in Microsoft Word. We however recommend using an html editor. Here are some easy to use,


Shared Values
----------
<li> Data visualized is data downloadable - including spreadsheets. If the data isn't available, let's not have our users "windows shop" here.</li>
<li> Increase the use of existing content – more links, narratives, agency sites, other open data sites, colleague web maps/apps.</li>
<li> Create opportunities for engagement open to citizen comment. Create citizen buy-in to your story – “how is, has been or will… my say be used?”</li>
<li> There are 900+ data layers in <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov">opendata.dc.gov</a>. Use it as a source. Let us know if you need data published to DC's Data Catalog.</li>

How to use
----------
This repository is a collection of samples designed for use with ESRI's opendata site builder. To use simply drop into a text box and replace images, text, and link urls as needed.


Glossary
----------
*Under Construction - thank you for your understanding*

 Term | Use
---|---
div| Defines elements; does not have any defined style of its own

p| A standard tag used for text, not always necessary but can help with code readability
ul| An unordered list; the opening tag that contains li elements
li| List items contained within ul or ol elements
img| Used to place an image; must be paired with a 'scr' tag to link file
span| allows for the insertion of style elements within another element
h#| This tag applies a header style to the text within; 1 being the largest and 6 being the smallest
href=""| Used in conjunction with 'a' tag; place url or source link in opening tag to make related text linked
src=""| Used in conjunction with 'img' tag; place url for img link in opening tag to add linked image
alt=""| Allows for 'alt' text to be included; important to readability of pages for page readers
