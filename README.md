This repository is under construction, thank you for your patience.

Introduction
----------
We are excited that you have chosen to lead and build an open data site. Just remember, your site's primary purpose is to be an <b>open data site</b> - explore, engage, educate and enrichment via data. The open data layout builder comes with many easily customizable cards. In addition to those, here you will find samples our open data team is recommending and requesting of you. We also recommend that you begin by thinking "small." You can always grow the site and its pages.

Shared Values
----------
<li> Data visualized is data downloadable - including spreadsheets. If the data isn't available, let's not have our users "windows shop" here.</li>
<li> Increase the use of existing content – more links, narratives, agency sites, other open data sites, colleague web maps/apps.</li>
<li> Create opportunities for engagement open to citizen comment. Create citizen buy-in to your story – “how is, has been or will… my say be used?”</li>
<li> There are 900+ data layers in <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov">opendata.dc.gov</a>. Use it as a source. Let us know if you need data published to DC's Data Catalog.</li>

How to use
